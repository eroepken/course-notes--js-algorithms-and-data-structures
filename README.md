# Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass
These are my notes and solutions from the [Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass](https://www.udemy.com/js-algorithms-and-data-structures-masterclass) course on Udemy. The number on each file indicates the video it references in the course. The name will also correspond with the problem or the video name. Any code samples copied down from the course will be noted in the file name with `from-course`.
